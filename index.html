    <h1>Privacy Policy for TRAK</h1>

    <div class="meta">
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 27, 2025<br>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 27, 2025
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TRAK ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information when you use our workout tracking application.</p>

        <li>We do not collect, transmit, or sell your personal information</li>
        <li>We do not use third-party analytics or advertising services</li>
        <li>You have complete control over your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Workout Data</h3>
    <p>When you use TRAK to track your workouts, we store the following information <strong>locally on your device</strong>:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Custom exercise preferences and favorites</li>
        <li>Rest timer settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To track your fitness progress and provide personalized workout recommendations.</p>

    <h3>2. HealthKit Data</h3>
    <p>With your explicit permission, TRAK may access the following data from Apple Health:</p>

        <li>Workout history</li>
        <li>Heart rate data during workouts</li>
        <li>Exercise time and calories burned</li>
        <li>Cardio workout routes (running, cycling, walking)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide comprehensive workout insights, sync workout data across your health apps, and display workout routes on maps.</p>

    <h3>3. Personal Information</h3>

        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Rest timer settings, weight units, haptic feedback preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Location Data (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you grant location permission, we use your location data <strong>only</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display interactive route maps for cardio workouts synced from HealthKit</li>
        <li>Show where you ran, cycled, or walked</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Location data is only used when the app is in use and only for displaying routes. We do not track your location in the background or share it with anyone.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li><strong>Calculate statistics</strong> - Compute PRs, volume, training frequency, and muscle group balance</li>
        <li><strong>Provide recommendations</strong> - Suggest appropriate weights based on your history</li>
        <li><strong>Gamification</strong> - Award XP, levels, achievements, and rewards for motivation</li>
